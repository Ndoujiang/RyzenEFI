**Disclaimer** 

This Ryzen based Hackintosh is my first Hackintosh build/installation ever, and so far I've had no issues booting up, accessing the internet, downloading apps from the app store, or using the system native audio. I am not an expert in building Hackintosh systems and may have just gotten lucky with the configuration I used. 

That being said, there is a good chance I included extra Kexts and SSDT's in my configuration that are unnecessary for a successful installation and may or may not cause complications down the road.  

If you have system specifications identical to mine and are using my EFI folder as a reference or as a base configration, feel free to add or remove different files and please let me know if there are changes I should make and implement in my config.plist to optimize the OS/ or prevent future complications.

Thanks!
