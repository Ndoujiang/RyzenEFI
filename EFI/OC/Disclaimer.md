**Disclaimer** 

This Ryzen based Hackintosh is my first Hackintosh build/installation ever, and so far I've had no issues booting up, accessing the internet, downloading apps from the app store, using native audio , etc. 

That being said, I most likely included extra Kexts and SSDT's in my configuration that are unnecessary for a successful installation. 

If you have system specifications identical to mine and are using my EFI folder as a reference or as a base configration, feel free to add or remove different files and let me know if there are changes I should make to implement in my own config.plist for a better macOS experience.
