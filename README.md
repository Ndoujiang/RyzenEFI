**Experience So Far**

Mojave runs perfectly well on my AMD build and so far I've had zero issues with accessing the internet, downloading apps from the App Store, using native audio , and other general usage. The only thing that isn't working at the moment is iServices, specifically iMessage, but I plan on resolving that later.
