[b]Experience So Far[/b]

Mojave runs perfectly well on my AMD build and so far I've had zero issues with accessing the internet, downloading apps from the App Store, using native audio , and other general usage. The only thing that isn't working at the moment is iServices, specifically iMessage, but I plan on resolving that later. 

[b]Inquiries[/b]

(1) Mojave is reporting my Ryzen 7 2700X as an Intel Core i5 for some reason, how would I go about changing that to the correct display?
(2) I have a second Kingston A1400 120GB SSD, is it possible to install any version of macOS in a RAID configuration to utilize that second A400?
